Weblang 
--------------------------------
Weblang is a plugin for **OmegaT**, free and open source CAT tool.

It provides the following additional functionality:
- on-demand exact match search (aka 'quotation mark' search) using Google Custom Search API
- background service for verifying translated segments

Weblang is currently a work in progress (unstable), any help is welcome.
